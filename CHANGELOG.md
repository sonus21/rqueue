## [2.2.0] - TBD
- Global queue priority
- Queue level priority
- Strict or weighted algorithm for message execution


## [2.1.0] - TBD
- Single or multiple execution of polled messages
- Single click message move  (dead letter queue to original queue)
- Queue level concurrency

## [2.0.0] - TBD
### Added
- Web interface to visualize queue
- Move message from one queue to another
- Latency visualizer
- Delete message from the queue
- Allow deactivating a consumer in a given environment

### Breaking Changes
- Renamed delayed queue to `__rq::d-queue::<queueName>` (Migration: Move all messages from `rqueue-delay::<queueName>` to `__rq::d-queue::<queueName>`)
- Renamed annotation field `maxJobExecutionTime` to `visibilityTimeout`

### Fixes
- **Spring** Optional Micrometer, in older version config class was importing micrometer related classes, that could lead to error if classes are not found. In this version now code depends on bean name using DependsOn annotation.

## [1.4.0] - 08-Apr-2020
* Allow queue level configuration of job execution time.
* Support to add Message processor for discard and dead letter queue

## [1.3.2] - 01-Apr-2020
* Support lower version of spring 2.1.x


## [1.3.1] - 27-Feb-2020
* **Fixed** Bootstrap issue due to optional dependencies of micrometer


## [1.3] - 11-'Dec-2019
### Added
* Expose 6 queue metrics using micrometer. (queue-size, delay queue size, processing queue size, dead letter queue size, execution counter, failure counter)
* An api to move messages from dead letter queue to other queue. (Any source queue to target queue).

### Fixed
* An issue in scheduler that's always scheduling job at the delay of 5 seconds. (this leads to messages are not copied from delayed queue to main queue on high load)


## [1.2] - 03-Nov-2019
* Fixed typo of *Later* to *Letter*


## [1.1] - 02-Nov-2019
* At least once message guarantee
* Reduced ZSET calls
* Lua script to make atomic operation

## [1.0] - 23-Oct-2019
* Basic version of Asynchronous task execution using Redis for Spring and Spring Boot
